The objective of the game is to destroy all bricks with a ball. You have 3 attempts until you lose the game. When you complete a level, your balls will be restored back to 3 attempts for the next round.

Scores are counted by the amount of impacts that happen between the ball and a brick. If you lose your ball, your score will be reduced by a quarter of itself. The game will display your cumulative score once you've completed a level, won the game or lost the game. Your score will be saved once you've cleared all levels or lost all balls.

Good luck soldier.
