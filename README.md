# Brick Destroy
This is a simple arcade game. The goal is to destroy a wall with a small ball. This is a variation of [Filippo Ranza's base game](https://github.com/FilippoRanza/Brick_Destroy) that I will be expanding on for my university's Developing Maintainable Software module assignment.

**Controls:**
|Key| Description |
|--|--|
| Space | Start/stop the game |
| A | Move player left |
| D | Move player right |
| ESC | Enter/exit pause menu |
| ALT+SHIFT+F1 | Open console |


The game will automatically pause if the player clicks out of the game.

Enjoy :D
